# Electric-Motor-Temperature-Prediction
Business Objective: This project aims to estimate temperature sequences inside Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors(PMSM) from given input sequences, that is, currents, voltages, coolant and ambient temperatures, and torque as well as motor speed. All sensor data is deployed on a test bench.
Business Problem: The main purpose of the data set's recording is to be able to model the stator and rotor temperatures of a PMSM in real-time. Due to the intricate structure of an electric traction drive, direct measurement with thermal sensors is not possible for rotor temperatures, and even in case of the stator temperatures, sensor outage or even just deterioration can't be administered properly without redundant modeling. In addition, precise thermal modeling gets more and more important with the rising relevance of functional safety.
